                        	<p>Quite simply, test-driven development is meant to eliminate fear in application 
                            development. While some fear is healthy (often viewed as a conscience that tells 
                            programmers to &quot;be careful!&quot;), the author believes that byproducts of fear include 
                            tentative, grumpy, and uncommunicative programmers who are unable to absorb 
                            constructive criticism. When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see 
                            positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better 
                            equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them. TDD eliminates tentative 
                            traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek 
                            out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out 
                            individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually 
                            tested and refactored. Kent Beck teaches programmers by example, so they can painlessly 
                            and dramatically increase the quality of their work.</p>

                            of core Microsoft technologies, this series has an author pool that combines some of the 
                            most insightful authors in the industry with the lead software architects and developers 
                            at Microsoft and the developer community at large.&quot; - Don Box Architect, Microsoft &quot;This 
                            is a great resource for professional .NET developers. It covers all bases, from expert 
                            perspective to reference and how-to. Books in this series are essential reading for those

                            ASP.NET AJAX server controls can encapsulate even the most powerful AJAX functionality, 
                            helping you build more elegant, maintainable, and scalable applications. This is the first 
                            comprehensive, code-rich guide to custom ASP.NET AJAX server controls for experienced 
                            ASP.NET developers. Unlike other books on ASP.NET AJAX, this book focuses solely on server 
                            control development and reflects the significant improvements in ASP.NET 3.5 AJAX and the 
                            latest Visual Studio 2008 features for streamlining AJAX development Adam Calderon and 
                            Joel Rumerman first review the core Microsoft AJAX Library and JavaScript techniques needed 
                            to support a rich client-side experience. Next, they build upon these techniques showing how 
                            to create distributableAJAX-enabled controls that include rich browser-independent JavaScript 
                            client-side functionality. The authors thoroughly explain both the JavaScript and .NET 
                            aspects of control development and how these two distinct environments come together to 
                            provide a foundation for building a rich user experience using ASP.NET AJAX.</p>
